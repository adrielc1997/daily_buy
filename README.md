# Recurring Crypto Spot Buy Bot ü§ñ

This repository contains a Python script designed to automate recurring spot purchases of a chosen cryptocurrency on the OKX exchange. It's set up to run automatically using GitHub Actions, leveraging environment variables for secure credential management and privacy.

## üåü Features

* **Automated Trading:** Executes recurring market buy orders on OKX.
* **Secure Credential Handling:** Utilizes GitHub Secrets to securely store API keys, secret keys, and passphrases, keeping them out of the public codebase.
* **Privacy-Focused:** The specific cryptocurrency being traded is configured via private environment variables, ensuring it's not hardcoded in the public repository.
* **Flexible Scheduling:** Configured to run on a schedule using GitHub Actions' `cron` jobs.
* **Balance Logging:** Tracks and logs balance changes for SGD and the purchased crypto asset.

## üöÄ Setup & Configuration

To get this bot up and running, you'll need to configure your OKX API credentials and define the trading parameters using GitHub Secrets.

### 1. GitHub Repository

* Ensure your repository is set up on GitHub.
* This repository's history should be clean of any sensitive information.

### 2. OKX API Keys

* Create an API Key on your OKX account with **Trade** and **Read** permissions.
* Ensure you have your **API Key**, **Secret Key**, and **Passphrase**.

### 3. GitHub Secrets

Navigate to your GitHub repository's **`Settings`** > **`Secrets and variables`** > **`Actions`**. Add the following repository secrets:

* `OKX_API_KEY`: Your OKX API Key.
* `OKX_SECRET_KEY`: Your OKX Secret Key.
* `OKX_PASSPHRASE`: Your OKX Passphrase.
* `OKX_BUY_AMOUNT_SGD`: The amount in SGD you wish to spend on each recurring buy (e.g., `5`).
* `OKX_CCY_CRYPTO_ASSET`: The symbol of the crypto asset you want to buy (e.g., `BTC`, `ETH`).
* `OKX_INST_ID_CRYPTO_USDT`: The instrument ID for the trading pair (e.g., `BTC-USDT`, `ETH-USDT`).

**Important:** Do not include quotes when entering the secret values.

### 4. Self-Hosted Runner (Optional, but recommended for static IP)

The workflow is configured to run on a `self-hosted` runner with the `okx-static-ip` label. This is crucial if OKX requires API calls from a static IP address. If you're not using a self-hosted runner or don't need a static IP, you'll need to adjust the `runs-on` line in `.github/workflows/recurring-buy.yml`.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

The bot operates through a GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/recurring-buy.yml`):

1.  **Schedule:** The `cron` schedule (`0 0 * * *`) means the bot will attempt to run daily at 00:00 UTC. You can modify this cron expression to suit your desired frequency.
2.  **Checkout Code:** It checks out your repository code.
3.  **Virtual Environment:** Sets up a Python virtual environment to manage dependencies.
4.  **Install Dependencies:** Installs necessary Python libraries (e.g., `requests`).
5.  **Run Script:** Executes the `buy.py` script, which reads the configured environment variables (from GitHub Secrets) and interacts with the OKX API to place orders.
